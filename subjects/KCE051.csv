question1||question2||answer
what is magnetic confinement?||Describe magnetic confinement?||Magnetic confinement fusion is an approach to generate thermonuclear fusion power that uses magnetic fields to confine fusion fuel in the form of a plasma. Magnetic confinement is one of two major branches of fusion energy research, along with inertial confinement fusion
How will you shield the plasma in a tokamak?||Give some advanced methods for shielding the plasma in a tokamak?||In a tokamak, magnetic field coils confine plasma particles to allow the plasma to achieve the conditions necessary for fusion. One set of magnetic coils generates an intense “toroidal” field, directed the long way around the torus. The first tokamak, T-1, began operation in Russia in 1958.
